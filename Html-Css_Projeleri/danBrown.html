            <h1>DAN <span>BROWN</span></h1>
            <p>
              Dan Brown is the author of numerous #1 bestselling novels,
              including The Da Vinci Code, which has become one of the best
              selling novels of all time as well as the subject of intellectual
              debate among readers and scholars. Brown’s novels are published in
              56 languages around the world with over 200 million copies in
              print.
              <br /><br />
              In 2005, Brown was named one of the 100 Most Influential People in
              the World by TIME Magazine, whose editors credited him with
              “keeping the publishing industry afloat; renewed interest in
              Leonardo da Vinci and early Christian history; spiking tourism to
              Paris and Rome; a growing membership in secret societies; the ire
              of Cardinals in Rome; eight books denying the claims of the novel
              and seven guides to read along with it; a flood of historical
              thrillers; and a major motion picture franchise.”
              <br /><br />
              The son of a mathematics teacher and a church organist, Brown was
              raised on a prep school campus where he developed a fascination
              with the paradoxical interplay between science and religion. These
              themes eventually formed the backdrop for his books. He is a
              graduate of Amherst College and Phillips Exeter Academy, where he
              later returned to teach English before focusing his attention full
              time to writing. He lives in New England with his yellow lab,
              Winston.
              <br /><br />
              Brown’s latest novel, Origin, explores two of the fundamental
              questions of humankind: Where do we come from? Where are we going?
